## The Public 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results

### Description:

The enclosed data set is the complete, cleaned results of the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Free response submissions and personally-identifying information was removed from the results by stackoverflow to protect the privacy of respondents. There are three files besides this README:


1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer. This data can be downloaded [here](https://info.stackoverflowsolutions.com/rs/719-EMH-566/images/stack-overflow-developer-survey-2022.zip)
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name. Column "question" provides more info to what the columns in the dataset mean, i.e.,"qname".
3. so_survey_2022.pdf - PDF file of the survey instrument
4. BreakIntoTech - .py file with the necessary codes to obtain the final analysis.

The survey was fielded from May 11, 2022 to June 1, 2022. 

### Project Motivation
The goal of this project was to highlight the best ways to enter the IT industry

I considered the following:
1. The formal education of current developers and this showed that the highest level of formal education for most developers is Bachelor's degree.
2. The different methods developers use to learn how to code. We saw that majority learnt how to code outside school and the top online platforms used are Udemy, Coursera and Codeacademy.
3. Lastly, we looked at the top tools and technologies developers are working with and what they would love to work with in the future. This will help bring you up to date on current tools in your desired role and help you decide what tool to learn as well.
